## Introduction

Taking a computer science degree is the path that I have never been thinking of, at least until final year at high school. Long story short, now I am final semester student at ITS, [Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepuluh_Nopember_Institute_of_Technology). While I was still in the first year, I really pushed myself to comprehend all of the basic concept in programming. I could spent a whole day alone just to study, and forgetting about time, which is bad. As a proud muslim, I need to fulfill my mandatory pray, at least five times a day. Spending whole day and forgetting time is need to be prevented, so the idea came when it first crossed my mind. Simple notifications to remind daily mandatory prayer.

## How did I do it?

To develop a simple program that runs every time prayer time comes, I used Python with [macos-notifications](https://github.com/jorricks/macos-notifications) library by [Jorricks](https://github.com/Jorricks) to push notification to user desktop as seen below.

In every prayer time comes, Python script I wrote above need to run in order to push the notification to desktop. That's when the cron job kicks in. Most of unix-like operating system, provide command-line utility to run a program on scheduled, which is called cron job. Since I am a Mac user, the system already packed with linux kernel which include the cron job command.

### CRON Job

CRON job can be self-configure through terminal in most of unix-like operating system. Look at below simple example of cron job configuration.

```bash
# Cron job example to run script.py at every minute
* * * * * python3 /path/to/script.py
```

**Description**:
1. `* * * * *` represent the hour(s), minute(s), day(s) of the month, month(s), and day(s) in a week.
2. `python3` represent the python binary (should located at `/bin/python3`)
3. `/path/to/script.py` represent the path to which the script need to be run

Learn more about cron job [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/cron-jobs-in-linux/) or you can play around with the operator to give you a sense [here](https://crontab.guru/).

So I configure the cron job to be run in a specific time of prayer time using crontab and fetch the data from external source. Since I want to automatically update the cron jobs to adjust the time execution of pushing notifications script, I did the configurations through library [`python-crontab`](https://pypi.org/project/python-crontab/) that can configure cron jobs directly from Python.

### Data Source

For those of you wondering where did I get the prayer time data, I got it from open API from [Aladhan](https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api). I set another cron job to automatically fetch the data to Aladhan API every day at 9 AM to ensure that the prayer time is always up to date.

## Outlook

Expectations that this simple pray reminder program can be useful to fellow muslim developers out there that needs to be remind about prayer time. I know it look very simple at a glance, but this is really helpful, especially when you can't hear adzan from the nearest mosque.
